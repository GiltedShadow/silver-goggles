## Tools

#### JDK-17 
The main reason Java was chosen here was the familiarity of the language with the majority of the team. In this instance because of the short development time, it was important to ensure that as little time as possible went to learning or getting up to speed on a language, and with Java less than half of our team would need to catch up. Beyond that, Java is fairly old and quite stable at this point and is easily used across all ecosystems. JDK-17 is an older version, or more like not cutting-edge as far as development kits go, but will not be updated during the build process and is still within its service life and will likely be in use for quite a while.

#### NetBeans 21
A good thing about Java being so old is that there are a lot of IDEs available, and this specific IDE was chosen for a similar reason as Java - our team members with Java experience learned on this IDE and learning tools can lead to delays just like changing languages. This IDE also has quite a few benefits as well when it comes to creating and testing tools without additional steps or installation on top of the base IDE install.
