## Tools

#### JDK-17 
The main reason Java was chosen here was the familiarity of the language with the majority of the team. In this instance because of the short development time, it was important to ensure that as little time as possible went to learning or getting up to speed on a language, and with Java less than half of our team would need to catch up. Beyond that, Java is fairly old and quite stable at this point and is easily used across all ecosystems. JDK-17 is an older version, or more like not cutting-edge as far as development kits go, but will not be updated during the build process and is still within its service life and will likely be in use for quite a while.

#### NetBeans 21
A good thing about Java being so old is that there are a lot of IDEs available, and this specific IDE was chosen for a similar reason as Java - our team members with Java experience learned on this IDE and learning tools can lead to delays just like changing languages. This IDE also has quite a few benefits as well when it comes to creating and testing tools without additional steps or installation on top of the base IDE install.
 
#### MySQL
We have a little less choice when it comes to the database mangement software or SQL version, but SQL is SQL and there should be no issue even if the team has expereince with other versions. Not to mention every instance of SQL is essentially run hand in hand with a DBMS and these two should be the same that the whole groups has expereince with.

#### MS MySQL
This DBMS is used to control and manage the SQL database and is the software that is required for this project. The team as a whole has expereince with MS MySQL and should have no issues using and excelling with this software.

#### GitHub
As a version ccontrol software, GitHub is one of the most widly used and flexible software that can be used for free, and gives a good intro for the whole team. This is responsible for ensuring that the application mainccode is available to everyone, and that changes can be managed so that the application continues to grow without worrying about bricking the whole thing, and only the version that we are working on - not the last stable release.
